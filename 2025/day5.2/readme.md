## initial thoughts
for part 2, I need to deal with overlapping regions.  In an effort to not overengineer, I'm going to assume that my hypothesis in part 1 about not being able to store all the items may be wrong.

## first findings
I was right and wrong.  Right that I can't hold reference to all the valid ids, and wrong to discard my hypothesis.  Or, maybe right on two accounts, I just now have a validated hypothesis.

## result
evaluating ranges seems to work fine and I'm fairly happy with the outcome.
